Trial 100 in reinstatement did not inititate (trigger)camera (or it could have been a different tiral. I am not sure). 

It would be helpful to check the regularity of the time stamps (dat created) of the different blocks of image data to determine of there is a missing block in the middle).

Added 5 extra trials to compensate.
